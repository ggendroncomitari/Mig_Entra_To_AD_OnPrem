# ðŸš€ Entra ID to On-Prem Active Directory Migration

This project provides scripts and automation tools to migrate Windows workstations and users from Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) to an on-premises Active Directory domain.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Goals

- Export user information from Entra ID
- Create matching user accounts in Active Directory
- Migrate workstations from Entra ID to on-prem AD using the WAPT package
- Automate the process using PowerShell and WAPT

## ðŸ§° Prerequisites

### For User Export

- PowerShell 5.1+
- Microsoft Graph PowerShell module (`Microsoft.Graph`)
- Admin access to Entra ID / Microsoft 365

### For Workstation Migration

- WAPT package `comi-leave_Entra_to_OnPrem_0-1_PROD.wapt` (included in this repository)
- Set `comi-leave_Entra_to_OnPrem_0-1_PROD.wapt` as dependances to this computer using WAPT.

## ðŸ“¤ Export Users from Entra ID

Use `Export-EntraID-Users.ps1` to export all enabled users with useful properties (e.g., name, email, job title, department, etc.) to a CSV file.

```powershell
.\Export-EntraID-Users.ps1
```

## ðŸ‘¥ Import Users into Active Directory

Use Import-Users-To-AD.ps1 to create users in your on-prem Active Directory from the exported CSV file.

Update the script with:

Your target OU (Organizational Unit)

The default password for new users

```powershell
.\Import-Users-To-AD.ps1
```

## ðŸ’» Migrate Workstations from Entra ID to AD

To migrate workstations from Entra ID to your on-prem Active Directory, use the WAPT package included in this repository: comi-leave_Entra_to_OnPrem_0-1_PROD.wapt.

This WAPT package automates the migration process, including:

Unregistering the device from Entra ID

Joining the device to the local domain

Rebooting the machine if needed

Simply deploy and execute the package on each workstation using WAPT.
